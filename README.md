# StreetWar

## Description

The goal of this game is to get your opponent's health bar value to zero. To play this game the player must click on the fight button to start the play. The player must continue to click the fight button until the two opposing player's cards match in value. This is called "war". Once war has been established the player must click the war gif to deal the next card blow. Whichever card is higher will determine the winner of the "war" round and the losing fighter will recieve a -1 one hitpoint. If it is another "war", the play continues into a two-point round, and then further into a three-point round. If there is a fourth war, it is an instant death for both parties.
